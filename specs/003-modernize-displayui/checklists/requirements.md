# Specification Quality Checklist: Modernize DisplayUI.pm

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-01-24  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification follows the established pattern from 002-modernize-cseui
- Exit calls at lines 104 and 1083 are documented as a blocking issue requiring clarification during implementation
- The module already correctly loads config inside main() - this is noted for verification/preservation
- $slurpreg and $cleanreg package-level initialization identified as items to address
- 12 internal functions identified for private prefixing
